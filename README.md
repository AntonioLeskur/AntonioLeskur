## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AntonioLeskur GitHub.
I am a beginner coder with knowledge in Python and SQL.<br>
I come from a diverse background, with experiences in various fields ranging from hospitality and tourism industry to business.<br>
But in the last year and half I found my true passion, programing!<br>
I'm mostly self-taught programer. Few courses, some at universities some online...<br>
I really enjoy it, seems to get it pretty quickly and always hungry for more!!<br>
Feel free to check my projects!
