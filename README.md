## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AntonioLeskur GitHub.
I am a beginner coder with knowledge in Python and SQL.<br>
I come from a diverse background, with experiences in various fields ranging from hospitality and tourism industry to business.<br>
But in the last year and half I found my true passion, programing!<br>
My primary goal is to expand my knowledge and skills in Python programming.<br> I am passionate about honing my problem-solving abilities and developing practical applications using Python.<br> I am also eager to contribute to open-source projects, learn from experienced developers, and engage with the programming community.<br>
Feel free to check my projects!
