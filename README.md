- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my GitHub. I am a beginner coder with knowledge in Python and SQL.
- I come from a diverse background, with experiences in various fields ranging from hospitality and tourism industry to business.
- But in the last year and half I found my true passion, programing!
- I'm mostly self-taught programer. Few courses, some at universities some online...
- I really enjoy it, seems to get it pretty quickly and always hungry for more!!
- Feel free to check my projects!
